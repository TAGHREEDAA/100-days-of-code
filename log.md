# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 21, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: learning and try laravel TDD

**Thoughts:** Just started Today after a long time of hesitation, I was afraid if I can't continue but .. I feel very excited learning TDD for the first time so I find it a very exciting start to the challenge,
I thought TDD needs long time to learn it but I got a good idea to start deeping into testing and now I have a pretty clear idea about it.
I hope to enhance my skill in TDD using laravel the next coming days and to complete the challenge successfully.
