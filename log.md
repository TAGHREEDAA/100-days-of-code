# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 21, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: learning and try laravel TDD

**Thoughts:** Just started Today after a long time of hesitation, I was afraid if I can't continue but .. I feel very excited learning TDD for the first time so I find it a very exciting start to the challenge,
I thought TDD needs long time to learn it but I got a good idea to start deeping into testing and now I have a pretty clear idea about it.
I hope to enhance my skill in TDD using laravel the next coming days and to complete the challenge successfully.

### Day 3: February 23, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Still studying Laravel TDD (where to start and write the first feature test function ) .. 
Know about Model Factories and Faker library...
Also know about php Doc Blocks.
Working on Ticketing System as a trainning on the course just installed the laravel project and wrote a factory definition and 1 function in FeatureTests.

**Thoughts:** I didn't delve into coding yet .. but I need to read more and more to get an overall idea about how to make a real project.

I understood how to break the project into features.. selecting the main feature and choose it to start MVP project.
also I understood how to break the features into small functions to select which tests need to be created.

Before this I was stuck at the phase of large loop of development until reaching the main feature
I mean I was thinking in to develop the feature 1 which is the core feature of the MVP it depends on 2,3,4...etc sub features 
that are not important and not interesting so I lose my enthusiasm while creating migrations for the whole system then creating models...and so on, so I was spending alot of time before getting a working screen.

I'm excited and glad to work using TDD to get things done faster.
